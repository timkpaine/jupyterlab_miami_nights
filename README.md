A flat, 80's neon inspired theme for JupyterLab.

This theme is hightly inspired by artworks of 80's Neon, Synthwave and Cyberpunk. It is optimized for **long-term use** but colorful and cooool.

## Big update
There is a big update for the color scheme since version 3.0.0. If you are **old users** and don't like the new style, please find the archive [here](https://github.com/yeebc/jupyterlab-neon-theme/tree/archive_version2.x). However, unfortunately it would not be maintained anymore.

## Bonuses
**1. Search tool * Neon billboard**

**2. Collapser * Neon light**

## Customize
You may don't like the default background or the transparent UI, so codes concerning these controversial designs are separately put into [`custom.css`](https://github.com/yeebc/jupyterlab-neon-theme/tree/master/style/custom.css) and detailly commented for you to customize.

After you edited css files, please follow instructions in the [Development installation](https://github.com/yeebc/jupyterlab-neon-theme#development-installation) to reinstall.

### 1. Transparent left/top bar
PLease follow the comments to ajust the transparency.

### 2. Background
Two gradient backgrounds, 'Neon Night' and 'Neon Sunset', are provided. The default style is 'Neon Night' and you can uncomment codes to employ 'Neon Sunset' style.

To use an image as background, uncomment the corresponding part of codes, and change the url to the path of your image.

### 3. Fonts
To change fonts of editor and neon, firstly, add your font files to [`fonts`](https://github.com/yeebc/jupyterlab-neon-theme/tree/master/style/fonts) directory and update [`fonts.css`](https://github.com/yeebc/jupyterlab-neon-theme/blob/master/style/fonts.css) to register them. Then follow my comments to employ your registered fonts.


## Compatibility
To support gradient scrollbars showed in screenshots, **webKit browsers** like chrome are required. Otherwise, please activate the **Theme Scrollbars** in the **Top menu** --> **Settings** --> **JupyterLab Theme** for dark scrollbars (except **Edge**). This color scheme is primarily designed for python and ipynb, so there may be issues in other situations. If any problem you find, please report it to me in the [Github](https://github.com/yeebc/jupyterlab-neon-theme/issues) and I'll try to fix it as soon as possible.
